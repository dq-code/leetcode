1. two pointer search, searching from both start and end
   hashmap
   python copy list, a = list(b)
2. linkedlist, always create pivot
   inverse: walker = pivot
   reverse: always set as walking as pivot.next
3. use hashmap to record the location of already existed charactor, once repeatation found, starting from last occurance +1
4. IMPORTANT
5. Palindrome search, from middle to both left and right direction
6.
7. largest integer in python, sys.maxint
9. IMPORTANT
   div = 1
   while x/div >= 10:
    div = div*10
10. IMPORTANT
15. Think about sort first, combine hashmap and two pointer search; in order to use two pointer search, list has to be sorted first
17. DFS
19. IMPORTANT, tricky, two pointer for linked list
22. DFS
